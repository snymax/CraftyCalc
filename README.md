# CraftyCalc

Crafty Calc is Tutorial Generator for Minecraft and other Voxel based building games. Crafty Calc at this point calculates the points where blocks need to be placed to build a sphere. In the future I will be adding more shapes or designs.

## Planned Designs
* Vortex
* Ellipsis
* Torus
* Triangles

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please let me know.
